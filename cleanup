# Please follow the following 2 rules, unless called from a rebase command
# suggested by cleanrebase (i.e. via cleanupcommit). The cleanrebase tool
# depends on it:
# 1. always run on all files in the repository
# 2. always commit with the following exact commit message:
#    git commit -a -m 'run cleanup script'

# Strip trailing whitespace.
grep -Z -d skip -l . "$@" |
  xargs -0 -r sed -i 's/ *$//g'

# See #7995 comment #4.
# It is faster to grep for the pattern before calling sed.
# That is also why this is not a pure sed script.
